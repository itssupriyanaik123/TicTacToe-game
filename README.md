This is an TicTacToe game, noughts and crosses, or X's and O's is a paper and pencil game for two players 
who take turns marking the spaces in a three by three grid with X or O.
The player who succeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

Gameplay

There is no universally-agreed rule as to who plays first, but in this article the convention that X plays first is used.

Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is often played by young 
children who may not have discovered the optimal strategy.
Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good 
sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. 
It is straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially different 
positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space.
If played optimally by both players, the game always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.
The game can be generalized to an m,n,k-game, in which two players alternate placing stones of their own color on an m-by-n
board with the goal of getting k of their own color in a row. Tic-tac-toe is the 3,3,3-game. Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe is
an even broader generalization of tic-tac-toe. It can also be generalized as an nd game, specifically one in which n equals 3 and d equals 2.
It can be generalised even further by playing on an arbitrary incidence structure, where rows are lines and cells are points.
Tic-tac-toe's incidence structure consists of nine points, three horizontal lines, three vertical lines, and two diagonal lines,
with each line consisting of at least three points.
